# Select files or directories with lf

A simple plugin to let you select some files or a directory using [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf)

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Bundle `zsh-vi-mode` in your `.zshrc`

```shell
antigen bundle chmouel/zsh-select-with-lf
```

Load `zsh-vi-mode` as a plugin in your `.zshrc`

```

### Using [zgen](https://github.com/tarjoilija/zgen)

Include the load command in your `.zshrc`

### As an [Oh My Zsh!](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) custom plugin

Clone `zsh-vi-mode` into your custom plugins repo

git clone https://github.com/chmouel/zsh-select-with-lf \
  $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins/zsh-vi-mode

Keep in mind that plugins need to be added before `oh-my-zsh.sh` is sourced.

Load `zsh-vi-mode` as a plugin in your `.zshrc`

### Manual

Or any ZSH plugin manager (I use my own simple one [vtplug](https://blog.chmouel.com/2022/03/18/vtplug-a-very-dumb-and-tiny-zsh-plugin-manager/))

You can as well simply git clone this repository and source the
`zsh-select-with-lf.plugin.zsh` file if you want to do this just manually.

## Requirements

Only [lf](https://github.com/gokcehan/lf) is needed.

## Usage

Just do `C-x C-l` to select a directory and `C-x l` (C-x mean control and x) it
will start `lf` and put the result file or directory on your command line.

For files you need to select the files and press enter, for the directories you
need to navigate to the directory and press q to quit `lf`.

This plugin will try to do the right thing if you have a file or a directory on
the current word to have `lf` initially started on the right directory.

## Configuration

You can customize some variables

- `ZSH_SELECT_WITH_LF_FILE_BIND`: The keybinding to use to select files default to "^x^f"
- `ZSH_SELECT_WITH_LF_DIR_BIND`: The keybinding to use to select directories default to "^x^f"
